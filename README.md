# Procore Seed Tool

## Description

_This tool is currently in development and is not yet ready for use._

This tool is used to seed Procore projects with some basic resources that otherwise need to be manually created by Procore employees. It is intended to save employees' time by performing this repetitive setup programmatically.

This app serves a SPA (single-page application) that allows users to select a project and seed it with the desired resources. The UI is written in React and interacts with the backend's JSON API endpoint to make requests to the Procore API.

## Prerequisites

To access and use this tool, you need:

- don't know yet!

## Development

- to run the app locally:

  - `yarn build`
  - `rails s`

- run `yarn build --watch` to automatically rebuild the app when changes are made to files in /frontend
